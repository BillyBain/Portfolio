## Week 2 Homework

This week's homework  was to make a portfolio. This was a test to see if I could use HTML and CSS to make a website.  The tasks were to introduce yourself, show your works, and how to contact myself. 

Other requirements were to have the pageâ€™s header link to the different sections. Have clickable links to your works that you have done. Make one of the links larger than the others. Also to make the page responsive with a smaller screen size.

 You can access the portfolio at https://billybain.github.io/week-2-homework/.
