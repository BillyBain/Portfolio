## My Portfolio

This is my digital portfolio. Here I will be displaying my many coding projects. With this most 
recent update I have styled and added links to my recent coding projects. As well as links more ways to contact me.

Using Bulma framework, https://bulma.io/documentation/, and CSS I styled the website to look more 
professional. I also added Google Fonts, https://fonts.google.com/, to add a custom font to the webpage.

By linking my projects and assignment anyone who views my portfolio will be presented with my Github Repos where you
can view the completed projects. I used screenshots to show a preview and made them clickable to open a new tab with 
the website. To catch the users eye I added a filter to draw them in to view the content.
